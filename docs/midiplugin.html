<H1>MIDI input/output plugin</H1>

<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>
This plugin gives input/output support for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI protocol</a>
and gives the user freedom to control typical parameters like channels, Program Change and Control Change.<br>

The MIDI plugin can be quite powerful used in combination with MIDI devices such as keyboards, MIDI controllers 
(like Behringer BCF2000 or KORG nanoKONTROL) or a software audio sequencer like Cubase or Ardour 3.<br>
The usage can vary from fader-to-fader control (the BCF2000 case) to sequence triggering for synchronized
shows (metronome controlled gigs using an audio sequencer)
</P>

<H1>Configuration</H1>

<P>
When you click on the configuration button a window will appear, showing all the MIDI input and output lines
detected.<br>
Each line has two options that can be changed depending on your needs:
<ul>
 <li><b>MIDI Channel</b>: This is the channel where QLC+ will receive or send data through the MIDI system. MIDI channels can go
     from 1 to 16. The special "1-16" channel will tell QLC+ to receive or send data on any MIDI channel.
 </li>
 <li><b>Mode</b>: This is the MIDI mode that QLC+ will use to receive/send data through the MIDI system. 
     This parameter can assume two possible values:
     <ul>
      <li><b>Note velocity</b>: in this mode, QLC+ will receive/send data using MIDI notes velocity. MIDI notes can go from 21 (A0) to 108 (C8) and 
          each note can have a velocity going from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to match the DMX range (0-255).
      </li>
      <li><b>Control Change</b>: this is one of the MIDI protocol messages (like Program Change) frequently used by MIDI controllers.
      Each device should list the supported CC messages in its user manual, so please consult it before using this mode. The CC range can go
      from 0 to 127 and can have values from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to match the DMX range (0-255).
      </li>
      <li><b>Program Change</b>: this is one of the MIDI protocol messages (like Control Change) frequently used by MIDI controllers.
      Each device should list the supported PC messages in its user manual, so please consult it before using this mode. The PC range can go
      from 0 to 127 and can have values from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to match the DMX range (0-255).
      </li>
     </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
</P>

<H1>Feedbacks</H1>

<P>
The MIDI plugin is the one of the QLC+ plugins supporting feedback. When QLC+ detects a MIDI device with an output line, it will
enable the feedback check box in the <A HREF="file:howto-input-output-mapping.html">Input/Output panel</A>. Please note that output
and feedback are exclusive, so they cannot both be used at the same time.<br>
If your MIDI device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a visual/mechanical feedback to it. 
Devices such as the Behringer BCF2000 support this feature.
This is very useful during live shows to have immediate knowledge of the current state of faders mapped in QLC+.<br><br>

A small trick that can be achieved with QLC+ is to use feedback as a generic MIDI output line to trigger external controllers/sequencers.<br>
Let's look at some examples:
<ul>
 <li>Input: <b>OSC</b> ---> Output: <b>DMX USB</b> --> Feedback: <b>MIDI</b></li>
 <li>Input: <b>Enttec Wing</b> --> Output: <b>ArtNet</b> --> Feedback: <b>MIDI</b></li>
</ul>
</P>

<H1>MIDI beat clock</H1>
<P>
Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ supports the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_beat_clock">MIDI beat clock</A><br>
Not to be confused with the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_timecode">MIDI timecode</A>, the MIDI beat clock is 
a useful signal to sync BPM-based devices such as a drum machine with your lights controlled by QLC+.<BR>
Two special MIDI channels have been mapped in QLC+ to control your <A HREF="file:virtualconsole.html">Virtual Console</A> widgets
with a beat clock.<BR>
Here's a brief explanation of the special channels:
<UL>
 <LI><B>Channel 530</B>: A signal is sent on this channel when a beat clock starts or stops.</LI>
 <LI><B>Channel 531</B>: This signal is sent every BPM. QLC+ doesn't take any notice of measures (e.g. 3/4, 4/4, 7/8), so when setting up your MIDI clock you need
      to consider how QLC+ will handle it.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Hint</B>: If your controller is set to work at high BPM (e.g. 180-200), you might find difficult to catch the start signal.
One trick for doing this is to catch the stop signal. Example:<br>
<OL>
 <LI>Enable the QLC+ Virtual Console widget auto-detection</LI>
 <LI>Hit play on your device generating the MIDI beat clock. QLC+ will detect channel 530 and will switch very quickly to 531</LI>
 <LI>Stop the playback on your MIDI beat clock device. QLC+ will detect channel 530 again.</LI>
 <LI>Disable the QLC+ Virtual Console widget auto-detection</LI>
</OL>
In a similar way you can catch the beat signal as well. Just disable the auto-detection process before stopping the playback on your
beat controller (invert steps 3 and 4).
